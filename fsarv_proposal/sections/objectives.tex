\section*{Research Objectives}

This research addresses the limitations of current few-shot action recognition by developing and evaluating a novel framework for LLM-guided data augmentation. The core objectives are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \parsep=20pt
    \item \textbf{Develop an LLM-based Action Description Framework:} Leverage LLMs to generate diverse, semantically rich action descriptions, including variations and counterfactual scenarios, evaluated by the relevance and diversity of generated descriptions.
    \item \textbf{Design Augmentation Parameter Mapping:} Implement a method to map LLM descriptions to specific data augmentation parameters (Mixup, CutMix, rotation, etc.), assessed by the realism of augmented samples.
    \item \textbf{Evaluate Augmentation Effectiveness:} Assess the impact of LLM-guided augmentation on few-shot action recognition performance using benchmark datasets (Kinetics, Something-Something, HMDB51) and metrics like N-way K-shot accuracy, comparing against random data augmentation.
    \item \textbf{Compare with State-of-the-Art Methods:} Benchmark the proposed approach against existing few-shot action recognition methods to demonstrate its effectiveness.
    \item \textbf{Analyze Design Choices:} Investigate the impact of different LLM architectures, prompting strategies, and data augmentation techniques to optimize the framework and understand the interplay between LLMs and data augmentation.
\end{enumerate}
