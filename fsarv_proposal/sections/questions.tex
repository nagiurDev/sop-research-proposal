\section*{ Research Questions}

This research seeks to answer the following key questions regarding the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance few-shot action recognition through guided data augmentation:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{How can LLMs be effectively leveraged to generate diverse and semantically meaningful descriptions of human actions, including variations and counterfactual scenarios, suitable for guiding data augmentation?}
    \item \textbf{What is the most effective method for mapping LLM-generated action descriptions to specific parameters for various data augmentation techniques, ensuring the creation of realistic and relevant synthetic data?}
    \item \textbf{Does LLM-guided data augmentation significantly improve the performance of few-shot action recognition models compared to traditional data augmentation methods (e.g., random transformations)? }
    \item \textbf{How does the proposed LLM-guided data augmentation approach compare to existing state-of-the-art few-shot action recognition methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency? }
    \item \textbf{How do different LLM architectures, prompting strategies, and data augmentation techniques affect the overall performance of the LLM-guided data augmentation framework, and what are the optimal configurations for different action recognition scenarios? }
    
\end{enumerate}
