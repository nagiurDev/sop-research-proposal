\section*{ Expected Outcomes}

This research anticipates several key outcomes that will advance the field of few-shot action recognition. Firstly, we expect a quantifiable improvement (10-15\%) in few-shot action recognition accuracy on benchmark datasets like Something-Something-V2 and HMDB51, compared to state-of-the-art methods using standard random data augmentation. Secondly, the research will deliver a novel framework for LLM-guided data augmentation, encompassing methodologies for action description generation, parameter mapping, and data augmentation. This framework is expected to be generalizable to other few-shot learning tasks in computer vision. Thirdly, this work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the role of semantic information in data augmentation for few-shot learning, informing the development of more effective augmentation strategies. Finally, the research findings will be disseminated through publications in top-tier computer vision conferences and journals.
