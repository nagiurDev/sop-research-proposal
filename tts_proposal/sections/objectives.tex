    \item \textbf{Develop a robust multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) framework:} This framework will support the synthesis of high-quality speech for English, Bengali, and Chinese. 
    \item \textbf{Model and synthesize nuanced emotional expression:} The framework must be capable of accurately conveying a wide range of emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) in synthesized speech. This involves developing techniques for accurate emotion encoding and decoding within the TTS process.
    \item \textbf{Accurately capture and reproduce language-specific prosodic features:} The framework should effectively model and reproduce the unique prosodic characteristics of English, Bengali, and Chinese, including intonation, rhythm, stress patterns, and tonal variations. This requires specific modeling techniques for each language.
    \item \textbf{Enable control over speaker attributes:} The framework should allow for control over various speaker attributes (e.g., age, gender, vocal type) during synthesis. This enhances the flexibility and versatility of the generated voices.
    \item \textbf{Demonstrate industry-readiness of the framework:} The developed framework must demonstrate its practical applicability and potential for use in real-world applications like audiobooks, audio dramas, and documentaries. This might include showcasing the system's speed and efficiency in production contexts.
