\section*{ Expected Outcomes}

This research is anticipated to yield a robust, industry-ready multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) framework capable of producing high-quality, human-like speech in English, Bengali, and Chinese. The framework is expected to demonstrate significant improvements in the naturalness, clarity, and emotional expressiveness of synthesized speech compared to existing systems, particularly in capturing nuanced prosodic features and conveying a broader range of emotions. This will be evidenced by strong performance across various evaluation metrics, including objective measures (e.g., MOS scores) and subjective assessments (e.g., user evaluations). Furthermore, the research anticipates the publication of at least one high-impact journal article and multiple conference proceedings papers, demonstrating the framework's novelty and potential for widespread adoption.
