\section*{ Research Questions}

The research questions of this study are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item How can a multilingual TTS framework be developed that effectively handles the unique prosodic and tonal characteristics of English, Bengali, and Chinese, resulting in natural-sounding synthesized speech?
    
    \item What are the most effective techniques for accurately encoding and decoding emotions into speech, enabling the synthesis of emotionally expressive speech in the target languages? 

    \item How can the framework be designed to allow for the control and manipulation of speaker attributes (e.g., age, gender, vocal type) during synthesis, ensuring flexibility and versatility? 

    \item How can the framework be validated to ensure that the synthesized speech effectively meets industry standards for naturalness, clarity, and emotional expressiveness, especially for use in applications like audiobooks, audio dramas, and documentaries? 
\end{enumerate}
